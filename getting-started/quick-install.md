## Prerequisites

### Docker

Since this script uses the TerminusDB Docker container, you need to have Docker running.

On Windows and Mac, Docker Desktop can be [downloaded here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

On Linux, use your distro's package manager, or find [more information here](https://www.docker.com/products/container-runtime)

### Git

This script is distributed via GitHub, so you will need git to clone and update it, if you don't already have git, you can [download it here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Windows users should use the application "Git Bash" for all terminal commands described below, this application comes with Git for Windows.

### Sudo

Sudo is optional. As letting unprivileged users run docker is insecure, this script uses sudo by default if it is available.

Most users will not need to do anything here, sudo is installed by default on Macs and many populer Linux distros such as Fedora, Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu and Mint. Linux users who use minmal distros such as Archlinux, are advised to install sudo and confugure their sudoers file accordingly.

Windows users do not need to do anything here.

```
git clone https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-quickstart
cd terminusdb-quickstart
```

Run the container (the first time)

```
./terminusdb-container run

## If you've installed before

You may need to move or remove previous volumes or you may encounter bugs or the old console.

*Warning: This will lead to losing local data.*

```
 ./terminusdb-container rm

removing will delete storage and config volumes
Are you sure? [y/N] y
terminus_storage
terminusdb-config
```

## Using the console

Ready to terminate? Open the TerminusDB Console in your web browser.
```
./terminusdb-container console
```
Or go here: [http://localhost:6363/console](http://localhost:6363/console)
